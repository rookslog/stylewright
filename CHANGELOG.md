# Changelog

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- The `stylewright` engine, with `install`, `update`, `uninstall`, `list`,
  `doctor`, `lint`, `ground`, and `new-skill`.
- A guided install dialogue, which runs when you pass no flags. It detects the
  agents on your machine, lets you select skills one by one, and shows every
  destination path before it writes.
- The `simplified-technical-english` skill, distilled from ASD-STE100 Issue 9.
- Grounding matrices, which trace every statement in a skill to a numbered rule.
  A `G` row traces to the source. An `E` row is our own guidance.
- `stylewright lint`, which checks the part of ASD-STE100 that a program can
  check. Continuous integration runs it against our own documents.
- A conformance suite, which proves that the manual copy pathway and the engine
  pathway produce identical trees.
- The `new-skill` scaffold, which writes a skill that passes both checks from
  the start.

### Notes

- Install works by copy, never by symbolic link.
- `update` refuses to overwrite a file that you edited, unless you pass
  `--force`.
- `uninstall` removes only the files that the manifest records.
- Grounding matrices stay in the repository. No pathway installs them.
